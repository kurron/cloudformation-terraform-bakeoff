# Overview
See the master README for details.

IMPORTANT: before you can run the `composability` module, you need to edit and run `copy-files-to-s3.sh` otherwise there won't be any files for the master stack to run. After editing `copy-files-to-s3.sh` to use a unique bucket name, run `./copy-files-to-s3.sh` to execute the script and upload the stack files to S3.  This only has to be done once.
